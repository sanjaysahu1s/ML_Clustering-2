    "Hierarchical clustering is a type of clustering algorithm that creates a tree-like hierarchical representation of data points based on their similarities. It differs from other clustering techniques in that it doesn't require the number of clusters (K) to be specified beforehand. Instead, it organizes the data into a hierarchy of nested clusters, allowing for agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down) approaches."
